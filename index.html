    <h1>Dogs</h1>
    <h3>Man’s best friend</h3>
    <p>Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love. They depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. -Erica Jong</p>
    <p>Dogs are our link to paradise. They don’t know evil or jealousy or discontent. To sit with a dog on a hillside on a glorious afternoon is to be back in Eden, where doing nothing was not boring—it was peace. – Milan Kundera</p>
